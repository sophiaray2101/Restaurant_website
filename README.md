# This is my restaurant website project!

## Overview

* Website named after my favorite Italian restaurant called Pascucci's
* It is supposed to mimic an actual restaurant's website with features that customers would want in real life i.e. contact page, menu, order page

## Functionality

* Carousel where users can see pictures from the restaurant
* Menu page where users can view the menu items and prices
* Order page where users fill out a form with some required information, what they would like to order, and how much of it
* Contact page with social media icons that link to the real sites

## Tehcnologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 5.3

## Future Plans

* I would like to make the order form look more professional and sophisticated. I want it to look like a real order form where users type in how much of what item they like, scroll through different sections to find what they want, etc.
* I want to add an online payment option for users to "pay" online
* I want to add a feature where users can submit their own reviews as well and make the reviews more professional looking
